**1. Project Title: Characterization of DNMT3A Mutants in Binding to Histone Modifications for Mapping Unknown Interaction Sites.**

**Project Lead                             July 2024-Present**

My Role: Make mutant constructs, mutants purification with FPLC&SEC, test binding affinity with Alpha LISA & Anisotropy Florescence, test methyltransferase activity.

Challenges & Solutions: Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA.

Key Results: Make three constructs with high yield.

**2. Project Title: Elucidation of Succinate Dehydrogenase in Brucella Abortus for Designing Inhibitors against Brullosis.**

**Project Co-Lead                          March 2024-Present**

**3. Project Title: Construction of engineered E. coli that can degrade straw**

**Project Lead                             March 2023-Present**

My Role: To construct a series of microorganisms capable of degrading straw in an environmentally friendly manner, we designed a plan to clone the cellulase gene, manganese peroxidase gene, lignin peroxidase gene, and laccase gene from Trichoderma reesei and white rot fungi. Our goal is to transfer these genes into Î”mrdA-Escherichia coli, which has strong cell wall permeability. We aim to improve conditions for the high-level expression and extracellular secretion of target proteins in the engineered E. coli.

Key Results: I led a team of five people to complete the project defense and mid-term defense. Our work on this project earned us an award at the university level.

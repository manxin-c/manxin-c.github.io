**July 2024-Present**

#### Project Overview:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) interacts with histone modifications, playing a key role in gene regulation and contributing to the development of cancers and other diseases. However, the exact locations where some histone modifications bind to DNMT3A are still unknown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study focuses on identifying the precise binding sites of histone modifications on DNMT3A using AlphaLISA. By understanding where these interactions occur, we can better comprehend how they influence disease progression. This knowledge will help in designing inhibitors to disrupt these interactions, which could lead to new treatments for diseases linked to DNMT3A-histone interactions, particularly cancers. Through structural and biochemical methods, this research aims to support the development of targeted therapies that address these crucial molecular interactions.

#### Experimental Work Summary:
1. Constructed and purified DNMT3A mutants across various domains using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with nickle column and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), achieving a high yield and purity of mutant stocks.
2. Performed AlphaLISA binding assays and Fluorescence anisotropy with DNMT3A mutants, systematically refining buffer conditions to minimize signals arising from non-specific binding.
3. Working on constructing a truncated version of DNMT3A, devoid of a specific domain, to produce more reliable proteins for use in AlphaLISA binding assays.

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. Hard to find a proper buffer condition for AlphaLISA to prevent signals from non-specific bindings.
* Tried different combinations of distinct salt concentrations and various DNA types, which can help stabilize the proteins.
2. Excessive truncated contaminations are observed on the SDS-PAGE gel following FPLC and SEC, resulting in low purity.
* Tried various imidazole concentrations, increased the washing buffer volume, and utilized both His and Flag tags for protein purification.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Successfully created two significant mutant constructs, achieving both high yield and relatively high purity.
2. Identified optimal buffer conditions for AlphaLISA assays, achieving an ideal curve that confirmed our expectations based on previous papers.

#### Auxiliary Roles:
1. Assisted with a Cryo-EM project about CcrM by preparing proteins and actively participating in discussions.

#### **2. Structural Insights into Brucella abortus Succinate Dehydrogenase for Combating Brucellosis.**

**Project Co-Lead---IMU, Zhou lab**<br>
**March 2024-Present**

#### Project Overview:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brucellosis, a zoonotic infectious disease, occurs frequently in Inner Mongolia, China, posing a significant public health concern. Current treatments for brucellosis are not sufficiently effective, and drug resistance has become an increasing issue. One promising target for therapeutic intervention is succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a vital protein in Brucella abortus, a major causative agent of brucellosis. Notably, the SDH sequence in Brucella abortus differs significantly from its human counterpart, making it a viable target for selective inhibition. This study aims to elucidate the structure of Brucella abortus SDH in order to facilitate the design of specific inhibitors that can effectively combat brucellosis. By leveraging structural biology techniques, this research seeks to provide valuable insights into the development of new, efficient treatments for brucellosis, ultimately contributing to public health efforts in endemic regions like Inner Mongolia.

#### Experimental Work Summary:
1. Optimized the expression and purification processes of succinate dehydrogenase to ensure proportional expression of all four subunits, resulting in a well-structured and functional tetramer.
2. Performed skillfully in primer design, PCR, transformation, expression, purification using nickel columns and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting.
3. Proficiency in experimental workflow analysis, with the autonomy to independently adjust various parameters such as buffer concentrations, components, and conditions, and autonomously adaptable in refining experimental plans based on outcomes, including troubleshooting and optimizing protocols for success.

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. Failed to obtain a proportionately correct complex after purification with nickel gravity column and SEC, resulting in the failure to form a well-functioning tetramer.
* I am still working to resolve this issue.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Honed my operational skills to a high degree of proficiency with transformation, expression, purification, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and all related experiments throughout the process.
2. Identified possible explanations for the challenges encountered, suggested and implemented feasible strategies to resolve these issues, and confirmed their underlying causes.

#### **3. Construction of Engineering E. coli for Sustainable Straw Biodegradation**

**Project Lead ---IMU, Mo lab**<br>
**March 2023-Present**

#### Project Overview:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In environmental science and sustainable agriculture, managing agricultural waste like straw is a growing concern. Despite producing over 734 million tons of straw annually, much of it is underused and improperly disposed of, causing pollution. Biotechnology offers potential solutions, but there is still a lack of understanding about how to efficiently break down the complex structure of straw.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study aims to address that gap by exploring how engineered E. coli can be used to degrade straw. The goal is to develop a system where E. coli secretes enzymes to break down straw, making it more useful and reducing its environmental impact. The research could provide a sustainable way to manage straw waste and create valuable livestock feed, supporting a more circular agricultural economy.

#### Experimental Work Summary:
1. Cloned the cellulase gene, manganese peroxidase gene, lignin peroxidase gene, and laccase gene from Trichoderma reesei and white rot fungi and transfered them into Î”mrdA-Escherichia coli, which has strong cell wall permeability.

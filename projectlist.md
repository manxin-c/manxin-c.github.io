#### **1. Project Title: Characterization of DNMT3A Mutants in Binding to Histone Modifications for Mapping Unknown Interaction Sites.**

**Short-term scholar---UCSB, [Reich lab](https://reich.chem.ucsb.edu/)**                            
**July 2024-Present**

#### Main experiments been done: 
* Make mutant constructs(PCR, transformation, expression)
* Mutants purification with FPLC&SEC
* Test binding affinity with Alpha LISA & Anisotropy Florescence
* Test methyltransferase activity.

#### Challenges & Solutions: 
1. Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA to decrease the disruption from non-specific interactions.
* Try different combination of distinct salt concentration and different DNA used.
2. Hard to get both the high purity while a high yield of purified proteins.
* Try different concentration of imidazoles & use multiple tags & different techniques to purify the proteins.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Make two impirtant mutant constructs with high yield and relatively high purity.

#### Auxilliary roles:
1. Help another project with Cryo-EM to prepare the proteins and participate in the meetings.

#### Notewirthy qualities displayed:
1. Fast learner: I repeated every experiments by myself after shadowing the students in lab for only one time with successful outcomes, including purification, alphalisa, mutant construct building and methyltransferase.
2. Hardworking: I always prioritize the experiments' flow to maximize the efficiency for a earlier release of the scientific truth.
3. Communicative: Talk often with students in the lab to update and share pwespective and results concerning the projects.

### **2. Project Title: Elucidation of Succinate Dehydrogenase in Brucella Abortus for Designing Inhibitors against Brullosis.**

**Project Co-Lead---IMU, Zhou lab**
**March 2024-Present**

#### Main experiments been done: 
* Acquire the proteins (PCR, transformation, expression) with differnet vectors and distributions.
* Proteins purification with gravity columns & SEC.
* Use Cryo-EM to elucidate the structure of this tetramer.

#### Challenges & Solutions: 
1. Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA to decrease the disruption from non-specific interactions.
* Try different combination of distinct salt concentration and different DNA used.
2. Hard to get both the high purity while a high yield of purified proteins.
* Try different concentration of imidazoles & use multiple tags & different techniques to purify the proteins.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Make two impirtant mutant constructs with high yield and relatively high purity.

#### Notewirthy qualities displayed:
1. Reasonable Experiment Scheduling: I possess a comprehensive understanding of the entire workflow, which allows me to create and maintain a logical and efficient schedule for experiments. This foresight ensures that all project milestones are met in a timely manner without compromising the quality of research.
2. Extensive Literature Review: I have read a significant number of papers related to the project, which has equipped me with a deeper understanding of the subject matter and the ability to effectively troubleshoot any issues that arise. This proactive approach not only strengthens my knowledge base but also contributes to the overall efficiency and success of the project.

### **3. Project Title: Construction of engineered E. coli that can degrade straw**

**Project Lead ---IMU, Mo lab**
**March 2023-Present**

#### Main Purpose: 
To construct a series of microorganisms capable of degrading straw in an environmentally friendly manner, we designed a plan to clone the cellulase gene, manganese peroxidase gene, lignin peroxidase gene, and laccase gene from Trichoderma reesei and white rot fungi. Our goal is to transfer these genes into Î”mrdA-Escherichia coli, which has strong cell wall permeability. We aim to improve conditions for the high-level expression and extracellular secretion of target proteins in the engineered E. coli.

#### Main experiments: 
* Fungal RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription to cDNA.
* Acquire the target protein.
* Purifiaction with gravity columns.
* Determine the degree of straw degradation by the constructed microbial strains using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

#### Challenges & Solutions: 
1. Hard to extract the RNA with a desirable band showing on gels.
* Try different culture with different composition to culture the fungi.
2. Hard to get proteins released outside the walls.
* Try knock out extra genes connected with the permeability of the walls.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Led a team of five people to complete the project defense and mid-term defense. Our work on this project earned us an award at the university level.

#### Notewirthy qualities displayed:
1. Leardership: I reasonably assign work to my group members and effectively coordinate our efforts to achieve project goals.
2. Initiative: I am eager to learn and proactively seek out information to contribute to the project. This is my first time engaging with a scientific project, and I am committed to honing my skills and mastering the daily experimental procedures.

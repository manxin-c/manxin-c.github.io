## **1. Project Title: Characterization of DNMT3A Mutants in Binding to Histone Modifications for Mapping Unknown Interaction Sites.**

**Short-term scholar---UCSB, [Reich lab](https://reich.chem.ucsb.edu/)**                            
**July 2024-Present**

#### Main experiments been done: 
* Make mutant constructs(PCR, transformation, expression)
* Mutants purification with FPLC&SEC
* Test binding affinity with Alpha LISA & Anisotropy Florescence
* Test methyltransferase activity.

#### Challenges & Solutions: 
1. Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA to decrease the disruption from non-specific interactions.
* Try different combination of distinct salt concentration and different DNA used.
2. Hard to get both the high purity while a high yield of purified proteins.
* Try different concentration of imidazoles & use multiple tags & different techniques to purify the proteins.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Make two impirtant mutant constructs with high yield and relatively high purity.

#### Notewirthy qualities displayed:
1. Fast learner: I repeated every experiments by myself after shadowing the students in lab for only one time with successful outcomes, including purification, alphalisa, mutant construct building and methyltransferase.
2. Hardworking: I always prioritize the experiments' flow to maximize the efficiency for a earlier release of the scientific truth.
3. Communicative: Talk often with students in the lab to update and share pwespective and results concerning the projects.

**3. Project Title: Construction of engineered E. coli that can degrade straw**

**Project Lead ---IMU, Mo lab**
**March 2023-Present**

My Role: To construct a series of microorganisms capable of degrading straw in an environmentally friendly manner, we designed a plan to clone the cellulase gene, manganese peroxidase gene, lignin peroxidase gene, and laccase gene from Trichoderma reesei and white rot fungi. Our goal is to transfer these genes into Î”mrdA-Escherichia coli, which has strong cell wall permeability. We aim to improve conditions for the high-level expression and extracellular secretion of target proteins in the engineered E. coli.

Key Results: I led a team of five people to complete the project defense and mid-term defense. Our work on this project earned us an award at the university level.

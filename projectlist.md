### **1. Characterization of DNMT3A Mutants in Binding to Histone Modifications for Mapping Unknown Interaction Sites.**

**Short-term scholar---UCSB, [Reich lab](https://reich.chem.ucsb.edu/)**                            
**July 2024-Present**

#### Main experiments done:
1. Make mutant constructs (PCR, transformation, expression)
2. Purify mutants with FPLC & SEC
3. Test binding affinity with AlphaLISA & Anisotropy Fluorescence
4. Test methylation activity.

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. It is hard to find a proper buffer condition for AlphaLISA to decrease disruption from non-specific interactions.
* Try different combinations of distinct salt concentrations and different DNA.
2. It is hard to achieve both high purity and a high yield of purified proteins.
* Try different concentrations of imidazole, use multiple tags, and different techniques to purify the proteins.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Successfully created two significant mutant constructs, achieving both high yield and high purity.
2. Identified optimal conditions for AlphaLISA assays.

#### Auxiliary Roles:
1. Assisted with a Cryo-EM project by preparing proteins and actively participating in team meetings.

#### Noteworthy Qualities Displayed:
1. Fast Learner: After observing students in the lab just once, I was able to independently repeat every experiment with successful outcomes, including purification, AlphaLISA, mutant construct building, and methyltransferase assays.
2. Hardworking: I consistently prioritize the smooth flow of experiments to maximize efficiency and hasten the discovery of scientific truths.
3. Communicative: I frequently engage in discussions with lab members to update and share perspectives and results related to our projects.

### **2. Elucidation of Succinate Dehydrogenase in Brucella Abortus for Designing Inhibitors against Brullosis.**

**Project Co-Lead---IMU, Zhou lab**
**March 2024-Present**

#### Main Experimental Assignments:
1. Acquire the proteins through PCR, transformation, and expression, utilizing different vectors and distributions.
2. Purify proteins using gravity columns and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).
3. Employ Cryo-EM to elucidate the structure of the tetramer."

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. It is difficult to obtain four subunits in the correct proportion to form a well-functioning complex.
* Still working to resolve this issue.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Honed my operational skills to a high degree of proficiency.
2. Identified possible explanations for the challenges encountered, suggesting and implementing feasible strategies to resolve these issues and confirming their underlying causes.
   
#### Noteworthy Qualities Displayed:
1. Reasonable Experiment Scheduling: I possess a comprehensive understanding of the entire workflow, which allows me to create and maintain a logical and efficient schedule for experiments. 
2. Extensive Literature Review: I have read a significant number of papers related to the project, which has equipped me with a deeper understanding of the subject matter and the ability to effectively troubleshoot any issues that arise. This proactive approach not only strengthens my knowledge base but also contributes to the overall efficiency and success of the project.

### **3. Construction of Engineered E. Coli Capable of Degrading Straw in an Environmentally Friendly Manner**

**Project Lead ---IMU, Mo lab**
**March 2023-Present**

#### Main Experimental Assignments:
1. Extract fungal RNA and perform Reverse Transcription to cDNA.
2. Acquire the target protein from the Î”mrdA-Escherichia coli strain.
3. Purify the protein using gravity columns.
4. Determine the degree of straw degradation by the constructed microbial strains using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

#### Challenges & Solutions:
1. Difficulties in extracting RNA that yields a desirable band on gels. 
* Experiment with different culture media compositions to optimize fungal growth.
2. Difficulty in releasing proteins outside the cell walls. 
* Attempt to knockout genes associated with cell wall permeability to enhance protein release.

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. Led a team of five people to complete the project defense and mid-term defense. Our work on this project earned us an award at the university level.

#### Noteworthy Qualities Displayed:
1. Leadership: I assign tasks to my group members in a logical manner and effectively coordinate our collective efforts to achieve project objectives.
2. Initiative: With a strong desire to learn, I actively seek out information to benefit the project. As this is my inaugural engagement with a scientific project, I am dedicated to refining my skills and becoming proficient in daily experimental protocols.

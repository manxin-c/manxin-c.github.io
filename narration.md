## 1. Project Title: Characterization of DNMT3A Mutants in Binding to Histone Modifications for Mapping Unknown Interaction Sites.

### My Role: Make mutant constructs, mutants purification with FPLC&SEC, test binding affinity with Alpha LISA & Anisotropy Florescence, test methyltransferase activity.

### Challenges & Solutions: Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA.

### Key Results: Make three constructs with high yield.

## 2. Project Title: Elucidation of Succinate Dehydrogenase in Brucella Abortus for Designing Inhibitors against Brullosis.

### My Role: Make mutant constructs, mutants purification with FPLC&SEC, test binding affinity with Alpha LISA & Anisotropy Florescence, test methyltransferase activity.

### Challenges & Solutions: Hard to find a proper buffer condition for Alpha LISA.

### Key Results: Make three constructs with high yield.

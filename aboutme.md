I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Biotechnology at Inner Mongolia University in China. My research interests mainly lie in structural biology, with a focus on histones.

## Research Interests

#### **Histone Modifications:**

- Investigating how histone modifications regulate gene transcription and the roles of key enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases, in this regulation.
  
#### **Histone Assembly:**

- Exploring the mechanisms underlying the assembly of the histone octamer with specific chaperones.
  
#### **Key Words:**

- Structural Biology, Histone Modification, Histone Chaperone.

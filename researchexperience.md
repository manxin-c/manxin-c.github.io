title: Research experience
---


Here, I document my four research experiences, following the order from the most recent to the earliest, as a story about how these experiences contributed significantly to enhance my proficiency in conducting various experiments and help me discover my interests. Over time, I’ve developed a better understanding of how to approach research in a logical and effective way. Now, I feel more confident in designing my projects, making sure each step is well thought out and meaningful. These opportunities have not only taught me important lab techniques but also how to think like a scientist.

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first research experience at my undergraduate university in Professor Mo’s lab was when I truly worked on a real project, leading a group of four other students. However, a severe epidemic struck my city that year, causing us to lose nearly two semesters of lab work, and many of my experimental classes were moved online. To make matters worse, I found it difficult to balance an extremely hectic academic schedule—16 classes for a total of 33 credits—to make up for the postponed courses due to the epidemic. Thus, I knew very little about experiments when I first joined the lab. Despite this, I shadowed graduate students to learn some basic techniques and tried hard to spend more time in the lab. Also, I led my team to a successful project defense, and we won the second prize at the China International College Students Innovation Competition at the university level. Although my lab time was limited, I learned some basic techniques like running Agarose gels and SDS-PAGE gels, as well as PCR, but in a disjointed way, without fully understanding the complete experimental workflow. At the end of that semester, I was selected as an exchange student at Peking University, and I jumped at the chance. After returning from the exchange experience, I continued this project with my group, and we made steady progress, passing the mid-term defense.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my semester at Peking University, I took 15 credits and carefully selected a lab to join. At that time, I wasn’t sure what truly interested me in research. However, after attending a lecture by Professor Zihe Rao from Tsinghua University on structural biology, I was particularly impressed by his presentation on the dynamic conversion of SCARB2 in response to different pH conditions. The structures and animations that illustrated the dynamic conformational changes to interact with their substrate fascinated me. This fascination led me to join Professor Xiaodong Su’s lab, which specializes in structural biology. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly four months, I shadowed a postgraduate student, learning the entire workflow from gene acquisition via PCR to protein purification through size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), as well as initial crystallization screening for X-ray crystallography. I shadowed several experiments but quickly progressed because I worked hard to record every word she said about the experiments, took exhaustive notes, and asked questions whenever I was confused. Meanwhile, the postgraduate student trusted me to work independently after minimal supervision. This hands-on experience significantly improved my experimental skills. In addition to basic experiments, I also observed techniques like SPR, X-ray crystallography, negative staining, and flow cytometry. This experience solidified my passion for structural biology and gave me a deeper understanding of how scientific research works. It was also during this time that I decided to study abroad, influenced by the teaching professors and students in Su’s lab, who shared valuable information about planning for graduate research and summer opportunities.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to my home university, I sought out a professor who focused on structural biology so that I could apply for a summer research lab in the same field. I was fortunate to find Lecturer Zhou, who works on membrane proteins, particularly Complex II in the respiratory chain, and she welcomed me into her lab. This was my first time managing an entire project independently, from primer design to protein purification using size-exclusion chromatography, with minimal guidance from others. I was also responsible for fine-tuning the experimental conditions, including the concentration and composition of buffers, and for understanding how various factors could impact protein stability or yield. Previously, I had not delved deeply into these aspects, as my role was primarily to execute the instructions given by graduate students.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project was more challenging than I anticipated, as I faced difficulties in achieving a high yield of proteins with the correct proportion of subunits needed to form a functional complex. I explored various strategies, such as truncating random coil regions and testing different vector combinations, but we did not immediately obtain the desired results.Nevertheless, this hands-on experience greatly honed my proficiency in operational techniques and enhanced my grasp of the experimental process and all the trivial details I had to pay attention to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remained committed to solving the problem and continued my efforts until I received my visa, which was an important step toward my next research journey.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, I was invited by Professor Reich to conduct summer research in his lab at UCSB. After contacting him, he was extremely helpful, providing all the necessary documents for my visa application. I arrived on July 24th, but unfortunately, Professor Reich was out on a short trip. However, the next day, he organized a lab meeting where everyone shared their projects with me. Although the structural biology project I initially wanted to join was in a waiting phase due to sample analysis, I chose a project that intrigued me during the meeting: one focused on DNMT3A, examining its binding and methylation activity. I also kept in touch with the student working on the structural project to stay updated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on DNMT3A allowed me to learn various enzyme activity assays, which I had read about in papers before arriving. More focused on histone modification, I was obsessed with this topic we are trying to figure out. Now, I’m collaborating with the graduate student responsible for this project to explore and understand the properties of this enzyme through AlphaLISA. I truly enjoy the excitement of scientific discovery, which motivates me to work hard in the lab.</p>

title: Research experience
---


I have four research experiences, listed in reverse order from most recent to earlier ones. These experiences have greatly helped me discover my research interests and improve my proficiency in various experiments. Gradually, I have developed a scientific mindset that allows me to design projects in a correct and meaningful way. I'd love to explain how these experiences have shaped my research skills, but if you're not interested in the details, I’ve provided a brief summary below.

My first research experience at my undergraduate university in Professor Mo’s lab was the first time I truly worked on a real project, leading a group of four other students. However, a severe epidemic struck my city that year, causing us to lose an entire semester of lab work. To make things worse, many of my experimental classes were moved online, and we missed nearly two semesters on campus. When I first joined the lab, I knew very little about experiments, so I shadowed graduate students, learning some basic techniques. But I was also balancing an extremely hectic academic schedule—16 classes for a total of 33 credits—to make up for postponed courses due to the epidemic. Despite this, I led my team to a successful project defense, and we won the second prize at the China International College Students' Innovation Competition at the university level. Although my lab time was limited, I learned some basic techniques like plating and SDS-PAGE, but in a disjointed way, without fully understanding the complete experimental workflow. At the end of that semester, I was selected as an exchange student at Peking University, and I jumped at the chance.

During my semester at Peking University, I took 15 credits and carefully selected a lab to join. At that time, I wasn’t sure what truly interested me in research. However, after attending a lecture by Professor Zihe Rao from Tsinghua University on the structural biology of the virus SCARB2, I became fascinated by the complex structures and dynamic interactions between the virus and its substrate. This led me to join Professor Xiaodong Su’s lab, which specializes in structural biology. For nearly four months, I shadowed a postgraduate student, learning the entire workflow from gene acquisition via PCR to protein purification through size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), as well as initial crystallization screening. I shadowed several experiments but quickly progressed because the postgraduate student trusted me to work independently after minimal supervision. For tasks like vector extraction, where there was a protocol to follow, she let me work without overseeing everything. I recorded the procedures carefully and took detailed notes, asking questions whenever I was confused. Sometimes, my recordings lasted several hours. This hands-on experience significantly improved my experimental skills. In addition to basic experiments, I also observed techniques like SPR, X-ray crystallography, negative staining, and flow cytometry, though these were less frequent since negative results often required repeating prior steps. This experience solidified my passion for structural biology and gave me a deeper understanding of how scientific research works. It was also during this time that I decided to study abroad, influenced by professors and students in Su’s lab, who shared valuable information about planning for graduate research and summer opportunities.

When I returned to my home university, I sought out a professor who focused on structural biology so I could apply for a summer research lab in the same field. I was fortunate to find Lecturer Zhou, who works on membrane proteins, particularly Complex II in the respiratory chain, and she welcomed me into her lab. At the same time, I continued my first project with my original group, and we made significant progress, passing the mid-term defense. This was the first time I managed an entire project independently, from primer design to protein purification using size-exclusion chromatography. I also became responsible for smaller tasks like storing bacterial cultures and making antibiotic plates, which I previously hadn’t paid much attention to since I always followed the graduate students' instructions. Unfortunately, the project didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped, as we struggled to achieve a high yield of proteins with the correct ratio of subunits. I tried various strategies, such as truncating random coil regions and using different vector combinations, but we still didn’t get the desired results. Nevertheless, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the experimental workflow.

In April, I was invited by Professor Reich to conduct summer research in his lab at UCSB. He was extremely helpful, providing all the necessary documents for my visa application. I received my visa on July 18th, which coincidentally was the day I left Lecturer Zhou’s lab. I immediately planned my flight and accommodation in the U.S. I arrived on July 24th, but unfortunately, Professor Reich was out on a short trip. However, the next day, he organized a lab meeting where everyone shared their projects with me. Although the structural biology project I initially wanted to join was in a waiting phase due to sample analysis, I chose a project that intrigued me during the meeting: one focused on DNMT3A, examining its binding and methylation activity. I also kept in touch with the student working on the structural project to stay updated. Working on DNMT3A allowed me to learn various enzyme activity assays, which I had read about in papers before arriving. Now, I’m collaborating with a graduate student to explore and understand the properties of this enzyme, and I truly enjoy the excitement of scientific discovery, which motivates me to work hard in the lab.

  Brief Introduction: Up to now, I have already repeated the experiemtnal cycle of transformation, expression and purification for more than three times, contributing to plenty of mutants to be used for AlphaLISA. For AlphaLISA, I did two sets of design, one of which has the results just as we expected, while another one was not ideal, indicating a further effort we have to put to figure out the causes.

Here, I document my four research experiences, following the order from the most recent to the earliest, as a story about how these experiences contributed significantly to enhance my proficiency in conducting various experiments and help me discover my interests. Over time, I’ve developed a better understanding of how to approach research in a logical and effective way. Now, I feel more confident in designing my projects, making sure each step is well thought out and meaningful. These opportunities have not only taught me important lab techniques but also how to think like a scientist.

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first research experience at my undergraduate university, in Professor Mo’s lab, was my first time working on a real project, where I led a group of four other students. However, that year, a severe epidemic hit my city, causing us to lose nearly two semesters of lab time, and many of my experimental classes were moved online. On top of that, I struggled to manage an extremely busy academic schedule, taking 16 classes for a total of 33 credits to catch up on postponed courses due to the epidemic. As a result, I knew very little about lab work when I first joined and had limited time to spend in the lab.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these challenges, I shadowed graduate students to learn basic techniques and tried to spend as much time in the lab as possible. I led my team to a successful project defense, and we won second prize at the university level of the China International College Students Innovation Competition. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with techniques like running agarose gels and SDS-PAGE gels, and PCR. However, I learned these techniques in a scattered way and didn’t fully understand the complete experimental workflow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of that semester, I was selected as an exchange student to Peking University. After returning from that experience, I continued working on the project with my group, and we made steady progress, successfully passing the mid-term defense.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my semester at Peking University, I took 15 credits and carefully chose a lab to join. At that time, I wasn’t sure what area of research truly interested me. However, after attending a lecture by Professor Zihe Rao from Tsinghua University on structural biology, I was particularly struck by his presentation on the dynamic conformational changes of SCARB2 in response to different pH conditions. The structures and animations showing how these changes affect substrate interaction fascinated me, which led me to join Professor Xiaodong Su’s lab, specializing in structural biology.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly four months, I shadowed a postgraduate student, learning the entire workflow—from gene acquisition through PCR to protein purification using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and initial crystallization screening for X-ray crystallography. Although I started by observing experiments, I quickly progressed because I diligently recorded everything she explained, took detailed notes, and asked questions whenever I was unsure. Soon, the postgraduate student trusted me to work independently with minimal supervision, which greatly improved my lab skills.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond basic experiments, I also observed techniques like SPR, X-ray crystallography, negative staining, and flow cytometry. This experience deepened my passion for structural biology and gave me a clearer understanding of how scientific research is conducted. It was also during this time that I decided to study abroad, encouraged by the advice from professors and students in Su’s lab about planning for graduate research and summer opportunities.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to my home university, I sought out a professor who focused on structural biology so that I could apply for a summer research lab in the same field. I was fortunate to find Lecturer Zhou, who works on membrane proteins, particularly Complex II in the respiratory chain, and she welcomed me into her lab. This was my first time managing an entire project independently, from primer design to protein purification using size-exclusion chromatography, with minimal guidance from others. I was also responsible for fine-tuning the experimental conditions, including the concentration and composition of buffers, and for understanding how various factors could impact protein stability or yield. Previously, I had not delved deeply into these aspects, as my role was primarily to execute the instructions given by graduate students.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project was more challenging than I anticipated, as I faced difficulties in achieving a high yield of proteins with the correct proportion of subunits needed to form a functional complex. I explored various strategies, such as truncating random coil regions and testing different vector combinations, but we did not obtain the desired results. Nevertheless, this hands-on experience greatly honed my proficiency in operational techniques and enhanced my grasp of the experimental process and all the trivial details I had to pay attention to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remained committed to solving the problem and continued my efforts until I received my visa, which was an important step toward my next research journey.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, after reaching out to Professor Reich, I was invited to join his lab at UCSB for a summer research program. Upon my arrival on July 24th, it coincided with the professor's brief absence, but the next day, I attended a lab meeting where each member shared their research projects. Prof. Reich offered me the freedom to choose any project that interested me, and I selected the one that intrigued me the most: studying DNMT3A and its interactions with histone modifications. Concurrently, I maintained communication with the student involved in the structural biology project of CcrM, as it was awaiting the return of negative staining cryo-EM data and had no immediate assignments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on DNMT3A has allowed me to learn enzyme activity assays, something I hadn't done before. I’ve become deeply interested in understanding histone modification, which is the focus of this project. Currently, I’m using AlphaLISA to study the binding properties of DNMT3A. The excitement of scientific exploration keeps me motivated to put in the hard work at the lab.</p>

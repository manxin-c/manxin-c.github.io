title: Research experience
---

I have four research experience, following the order from late to before. These experiences contributed a lot to help me find where my interest are and to improve my operation on different experiments. I have gradually been equipped with a scientific mind to design how my project proceed in a correct and meaningful way. I would love to demonstrate how those experience attribute to my research here, if not interested, I wrote some brief summary below.
The first experience in my undergraduate university in Mo lab was my initial project truly deep into a lab to do a real project with other four students as a leader. However, a serious epidemic broke at my city that year, so we lost a semester of time to learn the operation. Even worse, some of my experimental classes were transformed to online classes because of the absense in school for nearly two semesters' time. I can say that I know very little about the experiments when I first got into the lab, shadowing the graduate students to learn some simple experiments. However, I had a very hectic academic schedule to accomplish 16 classes for overall 33 credits to compensate for some courses that postponed because of the epidemics. Additonally, I lead my team to accomplish out initial defense of our project and won the second award for China International College Students' Innovation Competition at the university level.Thus, I was super busy balancing my academic performance and the lab learning. This way, I learnt some basic operations concerning plating, SDS-PAGE, etc, but in a seperating way, which means I don't have a comprehensive control of the successive workflow. At the end of this semester, I got the chance to go to Peking University as an exchange student, so without any hesitation, I applied for lukily been chosen to go. 
During my semester in PKU, I took a total of 15 credits and meticulously select a lab to join and learn. Just before I try to select a lab matching with my interest to join, when I actually didn't know what really intrigued me, I attended a lecture given by Prof. Rao, Zihe from Tsinghua University about his research about the stuctural biology of a virus called SCARB2, from when I was obsessed with all the pictures and animations he displayed about the complex stucture and dynamic combination between the virus and their substrate due to change of pH. Grestly influenced by this, I contacted Prof. Su, Xiaodong, whose lab expertised at structural biology. Spending nearly four months in his lab shadowing a post-graduate student, I know the complete workflow from acquiring the genes through PCR to purify the proteins with SEC, and the Initial Crystallization Screening. I shadowed her for several times, because it was my first time did most of the experiments from them. I think what made me progressed quickly is that the post graduate always believe in me and let me to do all by my own after just one shadowing or even no shadowing at all. Like using the vectors extraction kit, where has the protocol to follow, so she just let me do wihtout overseeing around. This way, I record every time shadowing her and take notes of the experiemtns, asking questions as soon as I was confused. Sometimes the recording could be up to several hours. This whole and long progress did contribute to my skilled performance in experiental operation. Apart from some basic experiemtns I have to do to prepare a high-quality proteins, I also shadowed other experiments like SPR, X-ray crystallation, negative staining, flow cytometry and so on. But these experiemtns weren't done frequently since a negative result would lead to a repeat of all previous steps to improve the conditions. This experience truly cultivate a fond of structural biology in my heart and start to trult understand how science produce. Another thing has to mention is that I make my decision to study abroad during this semester, influenced by some professors and graduate students' view and a world-toward environment in PKU, I council a lot of professors and students in Su lab, they share many valuable info with me about the timing to plan and summer research, which is a crucial target that affected me a lot.
When I back to my school, I start to look for a professor doing the structural biology since I want to apply for a summer research lab focused on the structural biology, which I think would to easier to apply if I have a structual project to carry. Fortunately, I found Lecturer Zhou, Xiaoting, who is concentrated on the membrane proteins with a focus on the Complex2 on respiratory chain, meanwhile welcome me to join and give me a project to do. Surely, I didn't give up my first project, with all the members in the group, they done some progress while my absence, and we continue to work this semester, during which I passed the mid-term defense.

  Brief Introduction: Up to now, I have already repeated the experiemtnal cycle of transformation, expression and purification for more than three times, contributing to plenty of mutants to be used for AlphaLISA. For AlphaLISA, I did two sets of design, one of which has the results just as we expected, while another one was not ideal, indicating a further effort we have to put to figure out the causes.

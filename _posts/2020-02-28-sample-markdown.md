<p style="font-size: 17px;">I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Biotechnology at Inner Mongolia University in China. My research interests mainly lie in structural biology, with a focuse on **nucleosomes** and **ribosomes**, particularly in following areas:</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>*Nucleosome-related proteins:</strong> 
<p style="font-size: 17px;">- Investigating how histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression and the role of key macromolecular complexes in this process; exploring the mechanisms underlying the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of the histone octamer with specific chaperones. </p>

<p style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>*Ribosome-related proteins:</strong>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">- understanding how ribosomes assemble themselves and how to regulate this process.</p>

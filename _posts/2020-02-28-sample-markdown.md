I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Biotechnology at Inner Mongolia University in China.

My research interests mainly lie in structural biology, with a focuse on histones, particularly in following areas:

**Histone Modifications:** Investigating how histone modifications regulate gene transcription and the roles of key enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases, in this regulation.

**Histone Assembly:** Exploring the mechanisms underlying the assembly of the histone octamer with specific chaperones.
